            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <lg>
               <l>PRoud Hogen, Mogen's, we will make you bow,</l>
               <l>Have at you, greasy Butter Boxes now,</l>
               <l>Brave <hi>York</hi> once more against you does advance,</l>
               <l>And in him more then all the Power of <hi>France;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>'T oppose him is in vain, all you can do,</l>
               <l>Is nothing, his name's enough to Conquer you.</l>
               <l>But when in Person he vouchsafes to appear</l>
               <l>Prepare to think your day of Doom is near.</l>
               <l>That glorious <hi>Hero,</hi> never Arms put on</l>
               <l>But he made Victory her self his own;</l>
               <l>Who still has wav'd her white Plume o're his head,</l>
               <l>And now to vanquish you, by her is lead.</l>
               <l>Though 'tis a shame, (that worthy) should persue,</l>
               <l>Honour unto such Savage Bores as you.</l>
               <l>But you (this never dying same) shall know,</l>
               <l>What in his Countreys quarrel he dare do.</l>
               <l>Presumptuous Villains, could you find out none,</l>
               <l>But <hi>England's</hi> King, to use your jests upon?</l>
               <l>Slaves, you e're long shall know, none was less fit,</l>
               <l>To be a Subject for your scurvy wit.</l>
               <l>(But <hi>York</hi> in whose Illustrious name are charms,</l>
               <l>That Cowards hearts ev'n with pure courage warms</l>
               <l>And does infuse new Soul in ev'ry man,</l>
               <l>With much more vigour then dull Brandy can.)</l>
               <l>Will punish each affront that you have done</l>
               <l>To your inevitable destruction.</l>
               <l>Hee'l make you curse the time, you Pictures drew</l>
               <l>And draw some of ye, nay and hang you too,</l>
               <l>Full of your Fate, he's with our Fleet set forth,</l>
               <l>With such a noble train of English youth.</l>
               <l>That when those matchless numbers, you shall veiw,</l>
               <l>You'l think the world is come to Conquer you.</l>
               <l>Methinks I hear the injur'd Spirits call</l>
               <l>(For Vengeance) that did at <hi>Amboyna</hi> fall.</l>
               <l>Victims, to your unheard of Cruelty,</l>
               <l>(To those) that for them will revenged be.</l>
               <l>Their Souls do hover o're our Ships, and seem</l>
               <l>To promise Conquest both to us and them.</l>
               <l>Our Fleet like to a moving Realm, I see</l>
               <l>In Tryumph on the bosome of the Sea.</l>
               <l>Which bears it proudly, being a Jem of more</l>
               <l>(Worth) then sh' has worn upon her brest before.</l>
               <l>The Sea-gods wait upon it all along,</l>
               <l>And thousand water-Nymphs about it throng.</l>
               <l>The waves their Royal burden gently court,</l>
               <l>And all the wind's, with the calm Ocean sport.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Tithon</hi> gives <hi>Thetis</hi> leave, to entertain</l>
               <l>In all her charmes, our Gallants on the Mayn.</l>
               <l>And's pleas'd in spight of age and jealousie,</l>
               <l>They shall on his young Mrs. Bosome lye.</l>
               <l>Each Power to us, does kind presages give</l>
               <l>That as our cause is just, so we shall thrive.</l>
               <l>Wit is too like a common friend, indeed,</l>
               <l>VVho still forsakes us when we have most need.</l>
               <l>Or somewhat more should be by me exprest,</l>
               <l>But let our Canons speak to you the rest.</l>
               <l>And tell you to your ruines you must dye</l>
               <l>T'apease the wrath of Anger'd Majesty.</l>
